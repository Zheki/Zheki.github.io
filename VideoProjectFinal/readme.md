The Origami Tutorial  

~ Nadja Fejzic, Mikołaj Artur Dębicki, Rahan Alshaibani & Zheljko Nenadic - December 2020


Description:
The ancient art of Origami, found in Europe, China, and Japan, turns square pieces of paper into paper sculptures. We were inspired by the how to theme and decided to film an origami tutorial. The aim of the website was to display the tutorial, teaching the viewer the steps of making an origami flower. We worked on simplicity, limiting the website to just the purpose of the website, the video. This focuses the viewer’s attention on the tutorial and learning the steps of the origami. The progress bar cuts the tutorial into three main steps. We also added a progress bar that allows the viewer to move back and forth through the three main steps of the tutorial.

The process: We split the work between the content and the website. The content was filmed and edited by Mikołaj, while the rest of the team worked on building the website. Mikołaj, with his knowledge of Origami and after watching different YouTube tutorials, was able to film the tutorial in a manner similar to professional origamists, cutting and transitioning from step to step synced with the background music. The rest of the team split up the website, between laying out the html and css, and making sure that the progress bar works as planned. 

Reflection: 

The most tricky part about video editing was connected with so-called “to the beat” editing. In our work we tried to imitate the style of Wes Anderson and cut all the pieces so they perfectly work with the background music. Each snap of fingers, appearance of each label is synchronized with the beat. That part was really tricky, but rewarding.

The building of the website itself was not that challenging as managing the progress bar. Since it’s our way to make the website interactive, we struggled with making it be responsive to video timing. Moreover, we wanted to allow the user to switch between the 3 steps and be able to repeat the step he/she thinks needs to be improved. After we managed to implement this by using JavaScript, we decided that we want to have icons on the bar that would serve as an indication of successfully completed steps. One of the issues that we encountered was the fact that icons were changing on click (ex. if we click to watch the 3rd step, 1st and 2nd become marked as done with a check mark) but they were not changing once that specific part of the video had finished.
