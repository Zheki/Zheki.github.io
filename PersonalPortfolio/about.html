        <p id= "about_me">Hi, my name is Zheljko but almost everyone calls me Zheki. I am a junior at NYUAD majoring in Interactive Media. In this Portfolio
            you can explore some of my projects that I made for the course Communications Lab in fall 2020. I am interested in electronics, engineering, coding
            and many other things, however, this is my first experience in web design. I genuinely hope you enjoyed this portfolio and my other projects. Most
            of the IM people know me by this picture, so here it is... :)
        </p>
