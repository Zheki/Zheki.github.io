      <h2>Ansh</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Ansh Kachalia and I am a sophomore majoring in Economics, with a minor in IM. This project was my first time using Audacity and experimenting with sound. For this project I helped with two aspects. First, I created certain sounds that would mimic real WW1 sounds, such as that of gunfire which was created using staplers, books and clapping. Second, I helped with sound editing and layering and placements of sounds in order to create an auditory story.</p>

      <h2>Mohammad</h2>
      <p>Hi I am a sophomore doing a double major in IM and CS. This project was my first experience with sound design and using sounds in general to create something. Like Ansh this project helped in learning on how to create sounds from everyday objects and how they can be manipulated and used for entirely different purposes. The project also taught me how to mix and layer sounds in a way that they feel natural or in a way tell a story without words.</p>
